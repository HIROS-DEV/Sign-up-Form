# Project: Sign-Up Form OverView

The project is for Intermediate HTML and CSS Course of the Odin Project(URL:https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

(The Odin Project is the free course to become a fullstack web developer)

In this lesson, I had to create a Sign-Up Form using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

# Web URL

Web Page: https://hiros-dev.github.io/Sign-up-Form/

(This is not responsive site. So, if you watch the site using smart phone, page's layout would break)

# What did I learn through this course

I got more advanced knowledge and technics of CSS.

For example, I got a knowledge of Position(ex. relative, absolute) and how to style a web page using it. Or, knowledge of Selectors(ex. :root, :focus, :valid, :invalid)

I finished the project using these knowledge.

Also, I used some Git / GitHub commands such as "git checkout -b" or "git merge", because I wanted to get used to these commands more in preparation for the real working.

# Summary

Form is a indispensable part of today's web site.

And, I am very satisfied with the project.

Of course, I know I have to learn more.
Because, real form has server side validation and I have to add responsive styles.

But, today is ok.

Thank you for reading.
And, happy coding!!!
